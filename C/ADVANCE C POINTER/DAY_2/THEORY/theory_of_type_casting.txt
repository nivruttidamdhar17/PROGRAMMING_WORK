What it is not:(aka Myth about type casting): 
If instance of type T1 is cast into type T2 then 
the instance (of T1) gets converted into instance of T2. 
[MYTH ^^^: WE MUST DISCARD THIS AT THE EARLIEST !!!]

What is it?? 

1)  expression: valid combination of operators and operands. 
    validity of combination is checked against the following 
    properties of operators: 
        i)      ary 
        ii)     sequence : prefix/infix/postfix 
        iii)    associativity 
        iv)     precedence 
    + 
    type checking 

    a + b 
    a + b * c 
    a - b / c; 
    a[i] * *p; 
    a[j] * *p++; 

2)  Inferred type of an expression: 
    int a=10, b=20, c; 

    c = a * b; 

    type(a):int     ... declared by programmer 
    type(b):int     ... declared by programmer 
    type(a*b):int   ... by type inference 

3)  Let expr be an expression. 
    Let Ti be its inferred type. 

    int a; 
    int b; 
    expr : a + b * 10 
    type(a): int    ... declared 
    type(b): int    ... declared 
    type(10): int   ... inferred 
    type(b*10):int   ... inferred 
    type(a + b*10):int ... inferred 

    Ti = int 

    expr: a + b * 3.14f 

    type(a) = int           ... declared 
    type(b) = int           ... declared 
    type(3.14f) = float     ... inferred 
    type(b*3.14f) = float   ... inferred 
    type(a+b*3.14f) = float ... inferred 

    Ti = float 

4)  Type casting: Type casting feature if supported by programming language, 
    gives programmer ability to OVERRIDE an inferred type of an expression. 

    The C Programming language supports type casting and a C programmer must use the 
    following syntax in order to use it. 

    (Tc)expr 

    Where Tc = Casted Type 
    Assume that Ti is an inferred type of the expression. 
    Tc != Ti 
  
    int a = 10, b = 20; 

    (float)(a+b); 

    expr -> Ti
    (Tc)expr 

    (Tc)expr

    OPERATOR((Tc)expr)
    OPERATOR(expr)
