1)  A callback function is defined by programmer but almost always called by 
    language compiler / library / OS. 

2)  Prototype / declaration of a callback function is partially or fully specified by the 
    language compiler / library or OS. 
    The prototype of function includes the following decisions: 
        i) name of the function 
        ii) total number of parameters of function 
        iii) type of each formal parameter of function 
        iv) return type of function. 
        v) calling convention of function 

LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam); 

3)  If name of callback function is not specified by the caller then it becomes 
    important to register an address of callback function to compiler / library / OS. 

4)  Compiler / library / OS usually call a callback function as a response to an event 
    which only they are capable for decection and not an application programmer.
