                            FILE HANDLING
                        
--- PERFORMS ACTION ON FILE.
--- USE HEADER "#INCLUDE<FSTREAM>".

**TYPES**
1)   IFSTREAM:-
    --- INPUT FILE STREAM.
    --- READ ONLY FILES.

2)  OFSTREAM:-
    --- OUTPUT FILE STREAM.
    --- WRITE ONLY FILE.

3)  FSTREAM:-
    --- FILE STREAM.
    --- READ AND WRITE FILE.


**OPERATIONS**
1)  OPEN()
    --- FILE ASSIGN.

2)  CLOSE()
    --- CLOSE FILE MEANS RELEASE FILE.

3)  GET()
    --- READ ONLY ONE CHARACTER FROM FILE.

4)  PUT()
    --- WRITE ON CHARACTR INTO FILE.

5)  READ()
    --- READ OBJECT VALUE FROM FILE.

6)  WRITE()
    --- WRITE OBJECT VALUE INTO FILE.

7) EOF(): END OF FILE
    --- RETURNS '1' IF FILE IS FINISHED ELSE RETURN '0' IF FILE IS NOT FINISHED.


**EXCEPTION HANDLING**

    --- TO HANDLE RUNTIME ERROR AND USED FOR CREATING RUNTIME ERRORS.
    --- THERE ARE ONLY THREE KEYWORDS IN EXCEPTION HANDLING.

1) TRY:- CONSISTS RUNTIME ERRORS STATEMENTS.

2) CATCH:- SOLVE THE RUNTIME ERRORS WHICH IS OCCURING IN TRY BLOCK.

3) THROW:- USED FOR CREATING RUNTIME ERRORS.

    ---THROW SYNTAX:- 

    ---THROW VARIABLE:-

    IT IS 100% RUNTIME ERROR STATEMENT. SO WHEN COMPILER EXECUTES IT, THEN IT THROW RUNTIME ERROR AND PROGRAM EXECUTION TERMINATES.

**TEMPLATES**

1)  FUNCTION TEMPLET: FUNCTION OVERLOADING

2)  CLASS TEMPLET: CLASS OVERLOADING.

FUNCTION OVERLOADING:-
        \* VOID ADD(INT A, INT B)
         {
            INT C=A+B;
            COUT<<"ADDITION : <<C<<ENDL;
         }
         VOID ADD(FLOAT A, FLOAT B)
        {
            FLOAT C=A+B;
            COUT<<"ADDITION: "<<C<<ENDL;
        }
        VOID ADD(LONG A,LONG B)
        {
            LONG C=A+B;
            COUT<<"ADDITION: "<<C<<ENDL;
        }        
        INT MAIN()
        {
            ADD(7.2,8.9)
            ADD(6L,3L)
            ADD(3,6)
            RETURN 0;
        }
       */
