                            file handling
                        
--- performs action on file.
--- use header "#include<fstream>".

**types**
1)   ifstream:-
    --- input file stream.
    --- read only files.

2)  ofstream:-
    --- output file stream.
    --- write only file.

3)  fstream:-
    --- file stream.
    --- read and write file.


**operations**
1)  open()
    --- file assign.

2)  close()
    --- close file means release file.

3)  get()
    --- read only one character from file.

4)  put()
    --- write on charactr into file.

5)  read()
    --- read object value from file.

6)  write()
    --- write object value into file.

7) eof(): end of file
    --- returns '1' if file is finished else return '0' if file is not finished.


**exception handling**

    --- to handle runtime error and used for creating runtime errors.
    --- there are only three keywords in exception handling.

1) try:- consists runtime errors statements.

2) catch:- solve the runtime errors which is occuring in try block.

3) throw:- used for creating runtime errors.

    ---throw syntax:- 

    ---throw variable:-

    it is 100% runtime error statement. so when compiler executes it, then it throw runtime error and program execution terminates.

**templates**

1)  function templet: function overloading

2)  class templet: class overloading.

function overloading:-
        \* void add(int a, int b)
         {
            int c=a+b;
            cout<<"addition : <<c<<endl;
         }
         void add(float a, float b)
        {
            float c=a+b;
            cout<<"addition: "<<c<<endl;
        }
        void add(long a,long b)
        {
            long c=a+b;
            cout<<"addition: "<<c<<endl;
        }        
        int main()
        {
            add(7.2,8.9)
            add(6l,3l)
            add(3,6)
            return 0;
        }
       */

using template:-
        template<class t>
        void add(t p, t a)
        {
            t r=p+a;
            cout<<"addition: "<<r<<endl;
        }
        int main()
        {
            add(6.2,7.9)
            add(7l,11l)
            add(3,10)
            return 0;
        }}
