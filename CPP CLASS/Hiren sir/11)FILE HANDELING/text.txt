                            FILE HANDLING
                        
--- Performs action on file.
--- Use header "#include<fstream>".

**TYPES**
1)   Ifstream:-
    --- Input file stream.
    --- Read only files.

2)  ofstream:-
    --- Output file stream.
    --- Write only file.

3)  fstream:-
    --- file stream.
    --- Read and write file.


**OPERATIONS**
1)  open()
    --- File assign.

2)  close()
    --- close file means release file.

3)  get()
    --- Read only one character from file.

4)  put()
    --- Write on charactr into file.

5)  read()
    --- Read object value from file.

6)  write()
    --- write object value into file.

7) eof(): end of file
    --- Returns '1' if file is finished else return '0' if file is not finished.


**EXCEPTION HANDLING**

    --- To handle runtime error and used for creating runtime errors.
    --- There are only three keywords in exception handling.

1) try:- Consists runtime errors statements.

2) catch:- Solve the runtime errors which is occuring in try block.

3) throw:- Used for creating runtime errors.

    ---throw syntax:- 

    ---throw variable:-

    It is 100% runtime error statement. so when compiler executes it, then it throw runtime error and program execution terminates.

**TEMPLATES**

1)  Function templet: function overloading

2)  Class templet: Class overloading.

function overloading:-
        \* void add(int a, int b)
         {
            int c=a+b;
            cout<<"Addition : <<c<<endl;
         }
         void add(float a, float b)
        {
            float c=a+b;
            cout<<"Addition: "<<c<<endl;
        }
        void add(long a,long b)
        {
            long c=a+b;
            cout<<"Addition: "<<c<<endl;
        }        
        int main()
        {
            add(7.2,8.9)
            add(6l,3l)
            add(3,6)
            return 0;
        }
       */

Using Template:-
        template<class T>
        void add(T p, T a)
        {
            T r=p+a;
            cout<<"addition: "<<r<<endl;
        }
        int main()
        {
            add(6.2,7.9)
            add(7l,11l)
            add(3,10)
            return 0;
        }
