1)COMPILE TIME----->STATIC BINDING------>EARLY BINDING

2)RUNTIME----->DYNAMIC BINDING----->FUNCTION OVERRITING(1.FUNCTION NAME SAME.
                                                        2.PARAMETERS MUST BE SAME.
                                                        3)FUNCTION RETURN TYPE(DATATYPE) MUST BE SAME.
                                                        4)USED INHERITANCE.
                                                        5)BASE CLASS FUNCTION MUST BE VIRTUAL.)

                                                        
                                                        
                                                    

1) FUNCTION/METHOD OVERRIDING:
        i)If parent class reference variable have a self class object then it always call self class original property,
        but it never call any child class property.

        ii)If parent class reference variable have a child class object then it first gives the preference to chils 
        class overriden property.
        but if child class have an overriden property then it call self class original property, but self class does not
        have a mathod then it throw compiletime error but it never call any child class original property.




                PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION

i)A function must be virtual and equal to 0.
        e.g: virtual void area()=0;

ii) pure virtual function must be declared in a class.

iii) if a class have a pure virtual function, then class becomes an abstract class.

iv) we never create an object of abstract class.

v) if a normal class inheriates abstract class then must override all pure virtual function.


2) OPERATOR OVERLOADING:
        i)Operator used in objects then we have do overload it.
        


                

                **THIS**
i) It is keyword and used for calling current class member variable.
ii) It is inbuilt pointer varible so member called by '->' operator.
