                LOOPS IN PYTHON

    Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statement in out program for instances.

    loops makes it easy for a programmer to tell the computer, which set of instruction to repeat and how.

TYPES OF LOOPS IN PYTHON
    Primarily there are two types of loops in python.
    1)while loop.
    2)for loop.

    we will look into these one by one.

1) WHILE LOOP
    The syntax of a while loop looks like this:

    while condition:
        #body of the loop       ------the block keeps executing until the condition is true

    In while loop the condition is checked first.if it evaluate to true, the body of the loop is executed, otherwise not!
    If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check and execution] is continued until the condition becomes false.

    example:
        i=0
        while i<5:               ------->prints harry 5 times
        print("Harry)
        i=i+1

    
    Note: If the condition never becomes false, the loop pars getting executed.
