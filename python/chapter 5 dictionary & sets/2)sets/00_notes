SETS IN PYTHON:
Sets is a collection of non repetative elements.

s=set()       ----->no repetative allowed
s.add(1)
s.add(2)      -----> or set={1,2}

If you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical,
operators on sets, you can simply look at sets in python as data types containing unique values.

PROPERTIES OF SETS

1) Sets are unordered   => Elements order dosent matter
2) Sets are unindexed   => Cannot acces element element by index
3) There is no way to change items in sets.
4) Sets cannot contain duplicate values.


OPERATIONS ON SETS:
Consider the following set:
            s={1, 8, 2, 3}

1)len(s): Returns length of the set (i.e. 4 for above given set)

2)s.remove(s): Updates the set s and removes 8 from set.

3)s.pop(): Removes an arbitary elements from the set and returns the element removal.

4)s.clear(): Empties the set s.

5)s.union({8, 11}): Returns a new set with all items from both set  ==>{1,8,2,3,11}

6)s.intersection({8,11}): Returns a set which contain only items in both sets ==>{8}.
