                    STRING

String is a data type in python.
#string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
#we can primarly, write a string in these three ways.

1)Single quoted strings --> a='Nivrutti'
2)Double quoted strings --> b="Nivrutti"
3)Triple quoted strings --> c='''Nivrutti'''


"STRING SLICING"
1)A string in python can be sliced for getting a part of the string.

consider following string:
name="Nivrutti"
name= "N  i  v  r  u  t  t  i" ==> length=8
       |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
     (-8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1)-->Negative indices


2)the index in a string starts from 0 to (length-1) in python.
3)in order to slice a string , we use the following syntax:

        sl=name[ind_start:ind_end]
                    /         \
                   /           \
            first index     last index is
            included         not included.

        #eg:  sl[0:3] returns "Niv" -->characters from 0 to 3
        sl[2:5] returns "vru" -->characters from 2 to 5
         
        
   NEGATIVE INDICES:
   Negative indices can also be used as shown in above figure, -1 corresponds to the (length-1) index, -2 to (length-2)....


*SLICING WITH SKIP VALUE*
We can provide a skip value as a part of our slice like this:
 
     word="amazing"
     word[1:6:2] --->'mzn'

   Other advanced slicing technique

     word="amazing"
     word[:7] ---> word[0:7] --->'amazing'
     word[0:] ---> word[0:7] --->'amazing'




** STRING FUNCTIONS**
    
    Some of the mostly used function to perform operation on or manipulate strings are:

1) len() function
-->this function returns the length of the string
     len("Nivrutti")---> return 8

2) string.endswith("tti")
-->this function tells whether the variable string ends with the string "tti" or not. if string is "Nivrutti", it returns true for "tti" since Nivrutti ends with tti

3) string.Count("c")
-->Count the total number of occurance of any character

4) string.Capitalize()
-->This function the first character of a given string.

5) string.find (word)
-->This function finds a word and returns the index of first occurence of that word in the string.

6) string.replace(oldword,newword)
--> This function replace the oldword with newword in the entier string.

7)Escape sequence character
--> Sequence of characters after backslash '\' (--->escape sequence chatacter)
--> Escape sequence character comprises of more than one character but represents one chatacter when used within the strings.

   eg: \n (-->new line), \t (tab),  \'(single quote), \\ (backslash),  etc.
