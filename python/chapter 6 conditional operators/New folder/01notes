                   CHAPTER 6: CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION
            

Sometimes we want to play pub-g on our phones if the day is sunday

sometimes we order icecream online if the day is sunday.

sometimes we go hiking if our parents allows.

All these are decision which depends on a condition being met.

In python programming too, we must be able to excuze instruction on a condition(s) being act. This is what conditional are for!


IF ELSE AND ELIF IN PYTHON.
If else and elif statement are a multiplying decision taken by our program due to certain condition in our code.



SYNTAX:

    if(condition1): ----if condition 1 is true
    print("yes")
    elif(condition2):----if condition 2 is true
    print("no")
    else:            -----otherwise
    print("maybe")



RELATIONAL OPERATORS:
Relational operators are used to calculate condition inside the if statement. some examples of relational operators are:

        ==    ----> equal to
        >=    ----> greater than/equal to
        <=    ----> less than/equal to



LOGICAL OPERATORS:
In python logical operators on conditional statements .
ex:
    and -->true if both operators are true else false.
    or  -->true if at lesat on operator is true else false.
    not -->inverts true to false and false to true.



elif clause:
elif in python means[else if]. An if statement can be changed togeter with a lot of these elif statement followed by an else statement.

    if(condition1):
        #code
    elif(condition2):
        #code
    elif(condition3):
        #code
    else:
        #code

    ---> This ladder will stop once a condition in an if or elif is true.



IMPORTANAT NOTES:

1)There can be any number of elif statememt.
2)Last else is executes only if all the condition inside elif fail.
